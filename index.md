Welcome on my personal page. 
I am Diane Maillot-Tchofo, a student at both [ENSAI](https://ensai.fr/en/) (Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'analyse de l'information) and the [University of Rennes 1](https://international.univ-rennes1.fr/en) enrolled in the master of Statistic, Public Evaluation and Decision Making, with a major in Statistical Studies. The french version is available here (url).

Personal projects, CV, research reports and surveys are available below.

### CV

My CV (in english) can be found [here](ttps://darrkhi.github.io/Diane-MT/CV_MAI_21_Anglais.pdf). (Last updated : Sept 21)


### Work/Internship Experiences

In the 2021 summer, I did a research internship at a the [ERIC](https://eric.msh-lse.fr/en/) lab located in Lyon (France), their areas of research are divided in 3 axes, namely Data Science, Business Intelligence and Digital Humanities.

I did a research intersnhip on automatic detection of Oil spills in marine areas using satellite SAR images. In the end I opted for the relatively new approach, namely Anomaly detection using GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), where an anomaly score between a generated image and the original one is computed. I discuss this method and the research process that led me to it in great length in my intership report.

During 4 1/2 months of intership I also wrote a couple of really short surveys on SAR images for oil spill detection and GANs for anomaly detection. Both are available below.

### Personal Projects

I have currently 2 personal projects running.

* Matheorie
* FootEuro

Matheorie was born during the first lockdown (in the spring of 2020), the aim was to offer an new perspective on Maths and its history by telling "unknown" and informative stories (e.g. the sory of the "0" until its full acceptation in Europe).
